Welcome to Harvey, an automated suite for recruiting eligible usability participants for research purposes, coupled with a suite of data visualization tools for common UX outputs, such as eye tracking and CSV (comma separated values).

The suite is free for you to use however you see fit. Take my code and tailor it to your needs, free of charge.

These tools were developed at the Full Sail User Experience Research lab, located in Winter Park, FL for the purposes of improving currently existing recruiting techniques.
